## Interests

* Towards the beginning of 2021, I got into crypto mining and have expanded my knowledge and hardware since then.
* I have an almost 2 year old German Shepherd named Luna. I like to spned time with her whehter it be teaching her new tricks or playing with her.
* I have been pretty into video games since my early childhood. Some of my all time favorites are The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the Dark Souls Series. I am currently playing Destiny 2 religously.
